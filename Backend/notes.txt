what is a server ?

res.status(200).send('hello world'); 
  double . what this exactly means 

more info on json and how the network call works
  + why wasn't my initial hello wolrd network call working
Become more comortable with json and json files
  also is json the most effecient way of sending data in a network ( effecient and practical )

mongo db me data storage padhna padega thoda fast way then long way

cors pe aur padh sakte hai
